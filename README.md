# study

Inspired by [vvksh](https://github.com/vvksh/learning_stuff), this is a place for me to record notes on whatever I'm studying. Each topic has its own issue and comments track progress. I take these notes locally in markdown in VSCode and then copy them over here.

## topics

- [modern cryptography](https://github.com/rrkane/study/issues/1)

## latex rendering

Many notes have inline LaTeX, indicated by dollar signs, e.g. `$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$`. I use the [mdmath](https://github.com/goessner/mdmath) extension, but this doesn't render in GitHub's markdown.
